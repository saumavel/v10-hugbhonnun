# HBV202GAssignment9
A project implementing the *Composite* pattern, *Observer* pattern, and a variation of the *Template Method* pattern based on JUnit4 tests.
### Overview
This project demonstrates design pattern implementations through a structured Maven project. It provides test cases to validate each pattern implementation.
### Project Structure
- `src/main/java`:
  - `is.hi.hbv202g.ass9.composite`: Implementation of the *Composite* pattern.
  - `is.hi.hbv202g.ass9.compositeObserved`: Implementation of the *Composite* pattern combined with the *Observable* pattern.
  - `is.hi.hbv202g.ass9.compositeObservedTemplateMethod`: Refactored implementation using the *Template Method* pattern.

- `src/test/java`:
  - `is.hi.hbv202g.ass9.composite`: Test cases for the Composite implementation.
  - `is.hi.hbv202g.ass9.compositeObserved`: Test cases for the Composite with Observer implementation.
  - `is.hi.hbv202g.ass9.compositeObservedTemplateMethod`: Test cases for the Template Method refactoring.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Maven
### Installation
#### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HBV202GAssignment9.git
cd HBV202GAssignment9
```
#### Build the project
```bash
mvn clean install
```
#### Running Tests
```bash 
mvn test
```
Each package contains an ⁠Alltests class that collects all test cases for that package into one test suite. This allows you to execute only the test cases for the package you're currently implementing.
#### Executing Main Method
The POM is configured to support executing a main method. You can run the main class using:
```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="is.hi.hbv202g.ass9.CompositeMain"
```
#### Generating Documentation
```bash
mvn site
```
This generates Javadoc documentation and places it in ⁠target/site/index.html.
## Design Patterns Implemented
#### Composite Pattern
The Composite pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
Template Method Pattern

The Template Method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
Testing Approach

The project uses JUnit4 for testing. Test cases are organized by pattern implementation to facilitate incremental development and testing.
